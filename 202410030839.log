202410030839.log test failed. termux fails to bring up pin entry therefore negating user interaction because it will need the password stored. Storing the password or using an agent is not desired however for now it can be enabled to explore further. Since git is using ssh signing commits with sshkey signing would simply confirm the upload. However once something such as the unanimous declaration content is verified a user interactive GPG signature attests it is true content and that I have verified it.
